# CSP Fix - Completed ✅

## Issue Summary
The subscription page was showing CSP errors when trying to fetch subscription data from the backend API. The error occurred because HTML meta tags were overriding the backend CSP headers, and the backend URL was not included in the HTML CSP connect-src directive.

## Root Cause
- HTML files (`subscription.html` and `payment.html`) had CSP meta tags that overrode backend CSP headers
- The `connect-src` directive in HTML files didn't include `https://milk-delivery-backend.onrender.com`
- This blocked the fetch request from `subscription.js:673` in the `loadCurrentSubscription()` method

## Changes Made
1. **Updated `frontend/public/subscription.html`**
   - Added `https://milk-delivery-backend.onrender.com` to CSP connect-src directive
   - Changed from: `connect-src 'self' https://api.razorpay.com https://lumberjack.razorpay.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com https://unpkg.com`
   - Changed to: `connect-src 'self' https://api.razorpay.com https://lumberjack.razorpay.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com https://unpkg.com https://milk-delivery-backend.onrender.com`

2. **Updated `frontend/public/payment.html`**
   - Added `https://milk-delivery-backend.onrender.com` to CSP connect-src directive
   - Applied the same change as subscription.html

## Files Modified
- ✅ `frontend/public/subscription.html`
- ✅ `frontend/public/payment.html`

## Testing Status
- Changes have been applied to fix the CSP violation
- The subscription page should now be able to successfully fetch data from the backend API
- No other CSP violations should occur for these pages

## Next Steps
1. Test the subscription page to verify the API calls work correctly
2. Monitor browser console for any remaining CSP errors
3. Verify that payment functionality works without CSP blocks
