# Subscription End Date and Remaining Days Fix

## Issue
End date and remaining days are not being displayed properly in the subscription system.

## Root Cause
The `subscription_end_date` field in the `users` table contains incorrect values (NULL or 1970-01-01), causing the `DATEDIFF` calculation to return incorrect remaining days.

## Files Created
- `backend/fix-users-subscription-end-dates.sql` - SQL script to fix the database
- `backend/fix-users-subscription-end-dates.js` - Node.js script to execute the fix

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Run the Database Fix Script
```bash
cd backend
node fix-users-subscription-end-dates.js
```

### 2. Verify the Fix
- Check that subscription end dates are now properly calculated
- Verify that remaining days display correctly in both subscription and profile pages
- Test with existing subscriptions to ensure they show correct remaining days

### 3. Test the Application
- Navigate to subscription page
- Navigate to profile page
- Verify end dates and remaining days are displayed correctly

## Expected Results
- Subscription end dates should show proper future dates instead of 1970-01-01
- Remaining days should display positive numbers for active subscriptions
- Expired subscriptions should show "Expired" or 0 days remaining
