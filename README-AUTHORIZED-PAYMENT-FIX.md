# Razorpay Authorized Payment Fix

## Problem Description
The customer's payment has been authorized by their bank/card but has not been captured yet. Razorpay's legacy verification flow fails if the payment is only authorized and not captured.

## Solution Overview

## Key Features
- ✅ Handles both authorized and captured payment states
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing verification logic
- ✅ Optional auto-capture for authorized payments
