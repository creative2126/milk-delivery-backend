# Fix API Endpoint Mismatch - 404 Error Resolution

## Issue
Frontend POST to `/api/subscriptions` (no trailing slash) returns 404 because backend route is defined as `/` (creates `/api/subscriptions/` with trailing slash)

## Plan
1. [x] Fix the route mismatch by updating backend route definition to handle both cases
2. [ ] Test the subscription creation functionality
3. [ ] Verify the correct API base URL is being used

## Implementation Steps
1. [x] Add route handler for `/subscriptions` (without trailing slash) in subscriptionRoutes-fixed.js
2. [ ] Test the API endpoint with curl
3. [ ] Verify payment flow works end-to-end
